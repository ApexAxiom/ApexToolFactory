# AWS Amplify Deployment Fix

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Error in `lib/auth.ts` (Line 23)
**Problem:** Type assertion from `ReadonlyRequestCookies` to `Partial<RequestCookies>` was causing a TypeScript compilation error during the build process.

**Solution:** Changed the type assertion to use `as unknown as any` to safely check for the `set` method without triggering TypeScript errors.

```typescript
// Before:
if (typeof (cookieStore as Partial<RequestCookies>).set !== "function") {

// After:
if (typeof (cookieStore as unknown as any).set !== "function") {
```

### 2. Outdated `package.json` Scripts
**Problem:** Build scripts still referenced Prisma commands that no longer exist after the migration to S3-based storage.

**Solution:** Cleaned up scripts to remove Prisma dependencies:
- Removed `prisma-generate-if-env.mjs` and `prisma-migrate-if-env.mjs` from build command
- Removed `postinstall` Prisma hook
- Removed all Prisma-related scripts
- Simplified build command to just `next build`

### 3. Outdated Dependencies in `package.json`
**Problem:** Package.json contained many unused dependencies from the previous Prisma-based architecture.

**Solution:** Cleaned up dependencies to match the actual codebase:

**Dependencies (kept only what's needed):**
- @aws-sdk/client-s3
- iron-session
- next
- react
- react-dom
- ulid
- zod

**DevDependencies (kept only what's needed):**
- @types/node
- @types/react
- autoprefixer
- eslint
- eslint-config-next
- postcss
- tailwindcss
- typescript
- vitest

## Build Configuration
The `amplify.yml` is correctly configured:
- Uses Node 20
- Enables pnpm via corepack
- Runs `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`
- Runs `pnpm build`

## Expected Result
The build should now complete successfully without TypeScript errors, and the application will deploy to AWS Amplify.

## Environment Variables Required
Ensure these are set in AWS Amplify:
- `SESSION_PASSWORD` - For iron-session encryption
- `ADMIN_PASSPHRASE` - For authentication
- `AWS_REGION` - AWS region for S3
- `S3_BUCKET` - S3 bucket name for data storage
- `NODE_ENV` - Should be "production"
