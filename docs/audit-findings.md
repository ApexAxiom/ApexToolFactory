# Verification Notes

This document captures high-level observations from the QA verification pass.

- Numerous core requirements for authentication, multi-tenant enforcement, and pricing persistence are not implemented (see full report).
- Infrastructure stacks lack Aurora/PostgreSQL provisioning; application commands could not be executed because pnpm installation is blocked by network policy (see command output in audit log).
- Several UI flows are static mockups without data wiring, CSV tooling, or PDF branding that the specification demands.

Refer to the comprehensive audit response for prioritized remediation guidance.
