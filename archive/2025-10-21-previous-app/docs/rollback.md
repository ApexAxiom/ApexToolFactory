# Rollback guide

1. Identify the failed deployment in Amplify Hosting and note the last known good commit hash.
2. Revert locally: `git revert <bad_commit_sha>` or checkout the previous commit and create a hotfix branch.
3. Run validation locally:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm lint
   pnpm typecheck
   pnpm test
   ```
4. Push the revert/hotfix branch and ensure Amplify completes the build successfully.
5. If immediate rollback is required, redeploy the prior artifact from Amplifyâ€™s console while the new build runs.
6. After stability is confirmed, open a postmortem issue documenting root cause and follow-up actions.
